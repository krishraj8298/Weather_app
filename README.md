# Weather_app
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeatherMap API
Role: Individual Project

Built a simple and interactive weather application as a personal project to practice front-end web development skills. The app allows users to enter a city name and fetch current weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather condition. Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time data and used JavaScript to dynamically update the interface.

Highlights:

Used fetch() to call public REST API asynchronously

Displayed weather data using DOM manipulation

Designed a clean and user-friendly UI using HTML and CSS

Implemented basic input validation and error messages for invalid cities

Learned about API handling and improving user experience
